    "\n",
    "Summarization is a combination of generative Large Language models and task-optimized encoder models. The service provides summarization solutions for plain texts, conversations, and native documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Supported Input:\n",
    "- Text summarization only accepts plain text blocks. \n",
    "- Conversation summarization accepts conversational input, including various speech audio signals. \n",
    "- Native document summarization accepts documents in their native formats, such as Word, PDF, or plain text. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prerequisites:\n",
    "Make sure you have a Language resource deployed on Azure. If that's the case, you can fetch your credentials -- Azure Language endpoint and key -- on Azure Portal. \n"

This approach aims to create AI that can better understand humans across different domains and languages. Through their efforts, Microsoft has achieved human-level performance on key benchmarks in speech recognition, machine translation, conversational question answering, reading comprehension, and image captioning. The ultimate goal is to develop pretrained models that can learn from multiple modalities and languages, akin to human learning, and incorporate external knowledge sources for downstream AI tasks. This progress is seen as a stepping stone towards a significant leap in AI capabilities, with a focus on multisensory and multilingual learning.

The specific details of the event, such as the topic or the speaker's credentials, were not addressed, but the core issue revolves around an ineffective presentation that failed to captivate the audience.
